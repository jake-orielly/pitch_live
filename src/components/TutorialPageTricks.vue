      <strong>Hands: </strong>
      Each game takes place over a number of hands. At the start of each hand,
      the players are dealt 6 cards. Then then make bids based on how many
      points they think they can take, based on the cards in their hands.
      Subsequent sections will explain the process of bidding and collecting
      points.

      <strong>Tricks: </strong>
      Once bidding is done, the player who won the bid goes first. This is
      referred to as them "having the lead". Each player takes turns playing one
      card, until all four players have played. At this point, the trick has
      been completed, and the team that won it will take all the cards that were
      played. The points won by your team will be determined by the cards you
      take winning tricks.
