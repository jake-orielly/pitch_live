            Games take place in lobbies, where you can meet up with the other people you'll be playing with.
            To start, choose either the "Create New Lobby" or "Join Existing Lobby" button. If you choose
            to create a new lobby, you'll be placed into a new empty lobby. You can see the code for your lobby
            in the upper left corner of the screen. Other players can then select "Join Existing Lobby", enter
            that code, and join you!
        </p>

            While waiting for the game you and your teammate can work together to decide your teams name using
            the selector at the top of the page. You will control one word and your teammate will control the other.
            You can also use the chat box in the bottom right to send messages to other people in the lobby. During the game,
            in addition to messages from other players, messages about game events, such as a card being played by another player,
            will appear in this chat box. You can scroll up to see anything you missed.
