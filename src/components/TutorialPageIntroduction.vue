      Welcome to Pitch Live! This project takes the classic playing card game
      Pitch, and makes it playable with your friends online. This tutorial will
      take your through the basic rules of the game, as well as the
      usage of the web interface. It may seem like there's a lot to learn, 
      but once you get into a game many of the elements will become more clear.
      Feel free to try it out and return to this tutorial whenever you'd like!
