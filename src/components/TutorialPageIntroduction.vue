            Welcome to my pathfinding demo. This project is designed to be an interactive way of showing how agents find paths to goals.
            By placing entities and terrain you can create custom scenarios and see how the agents react.
            There are also a number of settings to change what information is displayed, allowing for further investigation
            into how these systems work under the hood. This tutorial will explain the different tools available to you,
            feel free to exit and return to it at any time.
