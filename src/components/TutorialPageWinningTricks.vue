    <p>
      <strong>The Lead Suit: </strong>
      At the start of each trick, the suit of the first card played becomes the
      lead suit. For the rest of the trick, all other players must play cards of
      the same suit if they have them. This is called following. If you do not
      have cards of the lead suit, you may play cards of any suit. At the end of
      the trick, the player who played the highest card of the lead suit wins
      the trick.

      <strong>The Trump Suit: </strong>
      At the start of the hand, the player who won the bid will play a card.
      This card's suit becomes the trump suit. Cards of this suit beat all other
      cards, including cards of the lead suit. If you play the 2 of the trump
      suit, and someone else plays the Ace of the lead suit, you will win the
      trick. In addition, you can play trump at any time, instead of following
      the lead suit. When choosing the trump suit, you do have the ability to
      choose a suit other than that of the card you play though this move should
      be reserved for experienced players.
