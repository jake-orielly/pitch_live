    <p class="title">Points</p>
    <p>There are 4 points availible in each hand. High, low, jack, and game.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>High:</strong> Your team takes the highest availible card of the
      trump suit.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Low:</strong> Your team takes the lowest availible card of the
      trump suit.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Jack:</strong> Your team takes the Jack of the trump suit.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Game:</strong> The team that takes the most "Game Points". Aces
      are worth 4 points, Kings 3, Queens 2, and Jacks 1. 10's are worth 10
      points! Suit does not matter, and all other cards have no value.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not all of the points are available every game. Sometimes, no one gets
      dealt the Jack of the trump suit, and if the teams game points are tied at
      the end of the hand, neither gets the point. Keep this in mind when making
      your bids! Additionally, there is a secret, fifth point that is awarded in
      very special situations. If you bid 5, collect all four points, and take
      all 24 cards, you get awarded five points instead of four. However, if you
      don't bid five, you cannot win the fifth point. Making a 5 bid is
      one-in-a-million, and should only be attempted by experts and the truly
      desperate.
