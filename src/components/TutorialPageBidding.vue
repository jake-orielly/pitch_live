    <p>
      At the start of each hand, players take turns each making a bid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, there is the legendary 5 bid. If you bid 5, collect all four points, and take
      all 24 cards, you get awarded five points instead of four. However, if you
      don't bid five, you cannot win the fifth point. Making a 5 bid is
      one-in-a-million, and should only be attempted by experts and the truly
      desperate.
