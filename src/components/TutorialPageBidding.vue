    <p>
      At the start of every hand, players each take turns making a bid. A bid is
      an estimate of how many points the player thinks they can make, and must
      be at least two. In addition, if another player has already bid, the new
      players bid must be higher than the old one. If you do not want to bid,
      simply select "Pass". The last player to bid is the dealer, who has the
      option to either take the current bid, or pass. If there is no bid, the
      dealer must take it for 2. Bad luck!

      The player who wins the bid will lead the hand, meaning they get to decide
      what the trump suit is. This gives them a significant advantage in terms
      of earning points. However, if you make fewer points than you bid, your
      team will lose points equal to your bid, so be careful!

      Generally, if you have an ace and another card of the same suit, that's a
      decent 2 bid. If you have an ace and a face card, that's a decent 3 bid.

      Additionally, there is the legendary 5 bid. If you bid 5, collect all four
      points, and take all 24 cards, you get awarded five points instead of
      four. However, if you don't bid five, you cannot win the fifth point.
      Making a 5 bid is one-in-a-million, and should only be attempted by
      experts and the truly desperate.
